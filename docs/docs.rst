Writing Documentation
######################

If you have made some contribution to IT infrastructure of IIIT Sri City then surely you need to write documentation about the same so that it can be carried forward by others. Our documentation follows markdown syntax as far as styling is concerned. A brief step wise procedure is listed below.

Setting up the codebase
-------------------------

* First step is to clone `this <https://github.com/IIITS/documentation>`__ repository.
* Set up a Python virtual environment locally by issuing the command ``virtualenv <environment-name>``.
* Enter into virtual environment by ``source <environment-name>/bin/activate`` and install dependencies by ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
* Create your own topic branch with ``git checkout -b <branchname>``.
* Once all this is done properly you can perform your first build by doing ``make html``.

Writing Documentation
-----------------------

* Currently, we maintain a separate html file for every module and this html file is generated by rst file.
* You must adhere to the appropriate markdown syntax to get the expected output.
* Once you are done with writing set of docs. You may generate the html locally by doing ``make html``.
* The above command will generate html file which can be further viewed on browser locally.
* Once you've fixed all the bugs/errors you may push your branch and submit the pull request.
* Once the administrators accept your pull request, within two minutes changes will be reflected and your documentation page will come up on the website hosted.
